# squick
My personal workspace for developing libraries and tools for the LÃ–VE framework. Not fit to be templated from currently, but feel free to look around for usable library code that hasn't made it to its own repository yet.
## this branch should always boot successfully as a module!
Feel free to test it by submoduling it in and throwing a `require squick/squick` into your `main.lua`
