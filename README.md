# squick
My personal workspace for developing libraries and tools for the LÃ–VE framework. Not fit to be templated from currently, but feel free to look around for usable library code that hasn't made it to its own repository yet.
## Note: this will eventually be a modular project toolkit.
I hate IDEs but you gotta work with others somehow. Again, this isn't a production repo yet.
